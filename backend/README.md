# sea-trips-backend

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run backend server
```
npm run serve
```

### Delete DB with trips records
```
npm run deleteDB
```
Unrecommended to use this command while backend server is running.\
After DB deletion and starting new backend session, the mock data will be used to fill the DB.
